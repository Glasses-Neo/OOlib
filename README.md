# ðŸ‘‘OOlib
**OOlib is currently work in progress**ðŸ”¥


## ðŸ—ºOverview
OOlib is a syntax sugar which provides user-defined types, procedures, etc...


## ðŸ“œUsage
```nim
import strformat
import oolib


# add `pub` prefix to publish class
class pub Person:
  var
    name*: string
    age*: int = 0

  # auto insert `self` as first argument
  proc `$`*: string = fmt"<Person> name: {self.name}"

  proc happyBirthday* =
    inc self.age


# auto define constructor
let p = newPerson("myName")
```


## âœ¨Features
- Member variables with default values
- Defining `proc`, `method`, `func`, etc... (the only exception being `macro`)
- Auto inserting `self` as first argument
- Auto defining constructor (high performance!)
- Assistance with constructor definition
- `pub` modifier instead of `*`
- Inheritance with `of` modifier (for now, only object can be inherited)
- Creating Distinct type with `distinct` modifier
- `{.open.}` to allow inheritance

### ðŸ’­Planned
- Support for more modifiers (e.g. `[T]`, `{.pragma.}`)
- `let` member variables
- `super` keyword for `method`.
